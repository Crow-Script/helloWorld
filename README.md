# helloWorld
Hi
I love to code and create something from nothing, reason why i followed computing and web development. In fact i have done many jobs in the past in multiple fields (not only computing), it has only enriched my knowledge of the world, still there is much that i don't know, and much i want to learn and develop as a person, being one of my main goals and main motivation to keep learning and studying while working.
